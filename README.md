> [!NOTE]
> This project is still being worked on, and we **really** need help as we only have a few developers.   
> If you know C++ and think you can help out, hop into the Discord and let us know. :)

Come chat with us on our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mHN2BgH7MR).
For developer chat join `#developer` but stay on topic. Lurking is not only fine, but encouraged!

Discussing illegal activities, such as piracy, (illegal) hacking, doxxing/cyberbullying, and all other forms of copyright infringement will get you banned.

Currently, only Minecraft: Xbox One Edition runs with WinDurango.
See the [Game compatibility list](https://windurango.github.io/Documentation/playable-games.html)
for currently tracked games.

## Disclaimer

The goal of this project is to experiment, research, and educate on the topic
of emulation of modern devices and operating systems. **It is not for enabling
illegal activity**. All information is obtained via reverse engineering of
legally purchased devices and games and information made public on the internet
(you'd be surprised what's indexed on Google...). We are not any way affliated
with Microsoft.

## Building

See [here](https://windurango.github.io/Documentation/build-contrib.html) for instructions on setup. 

## Contributors Wanted!

Have some spare time, know C++ and have knowledge about Windows internals, 
and want to write code for the world's first Microsoft Xbox One compatibility layer?
Contribute! 

See more projects [good for contributors](https://github.com/WinDurango/WinDurango/labels/good%20first%20issue). 
It's a good idea to ask on Discord and check the issues page before beginning work on something.
